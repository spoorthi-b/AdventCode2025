# AdventCode2025
I will be solving problems from the Advent of Code calendar this year and posting my solutions here every day. Each solution will include my approach, thought process, and working code.

This repository serves as both a personal coding journal and a way to share solutions with the community. I’ll be tackling challenges in Python and exploring various algorithms, data structures, and optimization techniques.

Feel free to explore, provide feedback, or suggest alternative solutions. Learning together makes the journey even more fun!
